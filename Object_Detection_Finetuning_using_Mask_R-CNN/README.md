# Object Detection Finetuning using Mask R-CNN
This notebook is about finetuning a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model on the Penn-Fudan Database for Pedestrian Detection and Segmentation. 
It contains 170 images with 345 instances of pedestrians, and  it is used to illustrate how to use the new features in torchvision in order to train an object detection and instance segmentation model on 
a custom dataset.
